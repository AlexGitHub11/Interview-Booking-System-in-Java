Begin programme:

Upon initial running of the code the user will be asked to choose to log in as either an applicant or management,
from here both options can register an account and log in or log in if a n account is already set up. Once on the homepage for either
view you can choose from a menu of options explained below, or you can return to the landing page.
This is important because for applicants to use certain features you must have management approve requests, meaning,
you must return to the landing page and change to management view.
Additionally, applicants and management have a messaging system and for the communication to work, you must switch
to management to answer applicants and visa versa.

===================================================================================================================================
Applicant specific:

When successfully logged into applicant view you have three options:

1, Screening test

Here you can take a screening test provided you have request and been approved. Until these requirements are met
you will not have access to the test, to request a test read below.

2, Applicant status

Here you have an overview of your profile, on initial run no data will be in the view status however once you
go through the programme and request and compete all sections your scores and status will be shown here.

Below the status you have the option to add a description to your user witch will appear in the view status, after this you can either
request to take the test, go to the user inbox where you can send messages to management and view applicants Q&A, or, return to the home page.

Once you have requested a test, and it has been accepted by management you can then take the test, if you fail the test you will be
notified however if you pass the test you are then uploaded to another file in witch the management have to decide to book you in for
an interview or not. If you are booked this will appear in the view status page with all the relevant information.

3, Return to landing page

an interview e.g. user has completed all part successfully:

Application boundary's:

Some features my team implemented in the first assignment were too complicated for me to create in java due to this being my first,
experience with the programming language. The exceptions are listed and explained below:

Test configuration page
One feature we designed our project was allowed the management to have a build in IDE where they could format questions themselves,
I have not produced this work because when trying to i couldn't understand how to integrate a second ide into a terminal programme,

communication with application and desktop calendar programme
I did not make my programme connect with the users desktop calendar due to the complexity of getting the two programmes to work together.

Interview booked page
I have not created this page either because it was heavily dependent on being a GUI,
because of this I have included the relevant information on the view status page.
